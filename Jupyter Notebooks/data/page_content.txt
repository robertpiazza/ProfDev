<div class="dc-completed__message"><p class="">Great work! In addition to the suspicious number of <code>0</code> values, which may represent missing data, notice that the columns that contain monetary values - <code>'Initial Cost'</code> and <code>'Total Est. Fee'</code> - have a dollar sign in the beginning. These columns may be coded as strings instead of numeric values. You will check this in the next exercise.</p></div>
